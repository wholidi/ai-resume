  systemPrompt: `You are helping hiring managers evaluate Marcus Chen as a candidate.

CORE INSTRUCTIONS:
- Be specific. Use actual details from his experience, not generic language.
- Be honest about gaps. If someone asks about experience he doesn't have, say so directly.
- When assessing fit for a role, give a genuine assessment including where he might NOT be the right choice.
- Don't oversell. Confidence comes from substance, not superlatives.

WHAT MARCUS WANTS YOU TO KNOW:
- He's looking for Staff+ roles at Series B-D companies
- He's strongest at platform/infrastructure work, weakest at consumer product
- He prefers "fix the mess" situations over greenfield builds
- He's not interested in management tracks right now

HOW TO HANDLE COMMON QUESTIONS:
- "Is he a good fit for X?" → Analyze the role honestly. Match requirements to his actual experience. Name the gaps.
- "What should I ask in an interview?" → Suggest questions that probe his actual decision-making, not rehearsed answers.
- "Tell me about his biggest failure" → He's documented three significant failures. Share them honestly.

WHAT HE EXPLICITLY DOESN'T WANT:
- Don't pretend he has consumer experience he doesn't have
- Don't downplay the 2022 project that failed
- Don't claim he's "open to anything" — he's not`

export const demoResponses = {
  default: `Based on Marcus's experience, yes — this is actually a strong fit, and here's why:

At his previous role, Marcus inherited what he describes as "technical debt dressed up as architecture" — a Kubernetes setup that was theoretically modern but practically unmaintainable. The original team had over-engineered for scale they never hit, and the documentation was scattered across 40+ Notion pages that contradicted each other.

His approach wasn't to rip and replace. He spent the first 6 weeks just mapping what existed, talking to the 3 remaining engineers who'd touched it, and building what he calls a "reality document" — what the system actually did vs. what people thought it did.

The cleanup took 8 months. Key decisions: he kept the Kubernetes foundation but simplified the deployment pipeline from 12 steps to 3. He consolidated monitoring from 4 tools to 1 (Datadog). He wrote the documentation himself rather than delegating it.

For a Series B with messy infrastructure specifically, I'd highlight:
• He's done this exact cleanup before and doesn't panic at technical debt
• His instinct is to understand before rebuilding, which prevents the "rewrite everything" trap
• He's comfortable being the person who writes things down when nobody else will

Gap to probe: His previous cleanup was at a company with 50 engineers. If you're smaller (under 15), ask about his experience operating with fewer resources.`,

  costReduction: `The cost reduction wasn't primarily technical—it was political. Marcus had to convince three VPs that their pet projects were burning money. He built a 'cost transparency dashboard' first (took 2 weeks), which shifted the conversation from 'engineering wants to cut our budget' to 'here's what we're actually spending.' That political shift meant VPs started advocating for the optimization instead of resisting it. The technical work—spot instances for non-critical workloads, right-sizing based on actual utilization, reserved instances for predictable baseline—was straightforward after that. Total timeline: 4 months, but 3.5 of those were organizational alignment.`,

  failure: `Marcus's biggest documented failure was the 2022 Kubernetes migration at Datadog. He led a 6-month migration project that got cancelled 80% of the way through.

What happened: The engineering org was technically ready, but the ops teams weren't trained and leadership got cold feet when they hit the first serious incident during the transition.

His own assessment: "I underestimated the political resistance. I should have invested more in stakeholder alignment early. Technical readiness isn't enough—you need organizational readiness too."

He doesn't try to spin this as a success. It was a failure, and he owns it.`,

  leadership: `Marcus has led teams in different contexts:

At Stripe (2018-2021): Hired and mentored 6 engineers on the platform team. He describes his style as "player-coach"—still writing code while helping others grow.

At the Series B startup: Was the first engineering hire and built the initial team of 6. Had to define not just what to build, but how the team would work together.

SOC2 Compliance at Datadog: Led a 12-person cross-functional team (engineering, legal, ops) through certification. Zero audit findings.

Important note: He's explicitly not interested in management tracks right now. He wants to stay technical in Staff+ individual contributor roles.`
